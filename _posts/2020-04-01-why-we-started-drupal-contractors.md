By: Chris McGrath, Founder - Drupal Contractors

I can hardly believe that it has been 5 years since we started Drupalcontractors.com. Over the past year we have labored over re-inventing the site. My other firm Celebrate Drupal has funded the build out of an entirely new site. The site is still in Drupal 7 as it was started last July 2017 and we just were not comfortable with D8 at the time and replacing Profile 2, the module used to control our Profiles.

Drupal is a Community

Since early on in the history of the world wide web there have always been job and freelancer sites. As an early Internet entrepreneur I aso operated a niche site in partnership with Career Builder from 1996 to 2006 that focused on the changing manufacturing world. I learned there the special relationships that people who focus on a particluar niche market form. How targeted industry content not only helps inform people of goings on, or a new direction in their specific niche can not only help them advance and grow in their career and finding the next opportunity, not just help find the next ideal team member, but also build a community.

Drupal as many here know is already that. It is why I chose to focus on it as my own career and leverage the power of Open Source, and contribute back to it in every way that I could. We view Drupal Contractors as just an extension of the Drupal.org community. We work closely with the Drupal Association to find opportunities to sponsor and support ongong projects to advance the product.

In short we hope you find our platform useful and relevant to our industry of Drupal WCMS development. If you have any suggestions please don't hesitate to reach out so we can improve how we deliver the worlds best and largest platform to find Drupal development and management resources.
