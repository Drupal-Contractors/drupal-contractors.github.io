Imagine you're a DIYer, getting ready to remodel your house. 

Imagine you're heading over to your favorite home center for supplies to construct your walls, run some electrical wiring, and pick up some kitchen cabinets. 

Imagine you walk in and instead of seeing all these items, you find pine trees that you need to cut on your own, and copper nuggets that you're expected to melt down and shape into wiring. 

Sounds pretty ridiculous, doesn’t it? 

Well, once upon a time home builders actually did cut down trees and mill their own lumber. But it all started somewhere, and now, we’re well past that.

We can draw a parallel between home-renovation and web development. In the past we were expected to build our own menu system, forms, user and login systems, all from scratch. Thankfully, Drupal comes with all of these out of the box. 

However, there are lots of holes that need to be filled, and thankfully again, there are some great add-on modules out there. Many serve the same or similar purpose, some compliment others. They fit into many categories and you can “cherry pick” them to make the best combination. Let’s explore some of my favorite must-haves.

### **Presentation**

Presentation modules are those that produce or alter pages or parts of pages. They reduce the amount of work needed to create complete sections of pages, such as lists of products, image galleries, slideshows, customized member rosters, or even pages containing one or more of these elements. Here are a few great tools to help you make a great presentation.

#### V

#### Yes, Views, one of the most commonly used modules in the Drupal world, and it’s now in core. If you already know how much of a lifesaver it is, just move on. If not, add it to your project and start using it to present your content in pages and on blocks. Create reports, lists, even calendars with the addition of Views add-on modules, such as the Fullcalendar View module ([https://www.drupal.org/project/fullcalendar_view](https://www.drupal.org/project/fullcalendar_view "https://www.drupal.org/project/fullcalendar_view")).

To get a quick overview of Views and begin learning how to implement it, see another great training video by [WebWash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHT_Q7GH7dw) here, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHT_Q7GH7dw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHT_Q7GH7dw "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHT_Q7GH7dw")

Wait, there’s more! To make Views even more powerful, here are a few of my favorite Views addons:

### Infinite Scroll _(_[_https://www.drupal.org/project/views_infinite_scroll_](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_infinite_scroll "https://www.drupal.org/project/views_infinite_scroll")_)_

By a show of hands, who likes to click on the “Next” button to see more items in your search result? I know, I know, I can’t see your hands, but 10 to 1, no one is raising their hands. Instead, we like to scroll down the page and see more results, which is why so many people like the modern Facebook posts display, or Pinterest pins that never end (my personal favorite). You can add this functionality with the Infinite Scroll module.

### FullCalendar View _(_[_https://www.drupal.org/project/fullcalendar_views_](https://www.drupal.org/project/fullcalendar_views "https://www.drupal.org/project/fullcalendar_views")_)_

It’s pretty obvious what this one does. You’ll be pleased with how easy it is to implement and create custom calendars.

### Views View Field _(_[_https://www.drupal.org/project/views_field_view_](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_field_view "https://www.drupal.org/project/views_field_view")_)_

Want to see a list inside each row of data? This is best achieved with a child view that reads in that data and is linked to a field in the current row, and that is best achieved with this module. Any other way is just too much work.

### Views Slideshow ([https://www.drupal.org/project/views_slideshow](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_slideshow "https://www.drupal.org/project/views_slideshow"))

A long time favorite go to module for custom sideshows, the Views Slideshow module will make creating slideshows composed of several different pieces of content a snap. I should give you a fair warning though: theming the resulting slideshow can prove to be a daunting task.

### Views Accordion ([https://www.drupal.org/project/views_accordion](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_accordion "https://www.drupal.org/project/views_accordion"))

You know those simple lists that slide open to reveal a section with more info when you click on them? You know, like the ones on Samsung’s search result’s page ([https://help.content.samsung.com/csweb/faq/searchFaq.do](https://help.content.samsung.com/csweb/faq/searchFaq.do "https://help.content.samsung.com/csweb/faq/searchFaq.do"))? You can create the same, powerful dropdown lists in Drupal with the Views Accordion module. Get yours at a discount (as in “free”) before it’s all gone (um, nah, not gonna happen). Just get it already!
